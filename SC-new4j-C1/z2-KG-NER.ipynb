Estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

Our revenues have historically fluctuated based on consumer demand for devices, as well as on the timing of customer/licensee device launches and/or innovation cycles (such as the transition to the next generation of wireless technologies). This has resulted in fluctuations in QCT revenues in advance \\n40\\nof and during device launches incorporating our products and in QTL revenues when licensees’ sales occur. These trends may or may not continue in the future. Further, the trends for QTL have been, and may in the future be, impacted by disputes and/or resolutions with licensees and/or governmental investigations or proceedings.\\nFiscal 2023 Overview\\nRevenues were $35.8 billion, a decrease of 19% compared to revenues of $44.2 billion in fiscal 2022, with net income of $7.2 billion, a decrease of 44% compared to net income of $12.9 billion in fiscal 2022.

In addition to organic growth, we also focus on margin expansion through operational efficiency techniques, including lean, continuous improvement and 80/20, to drive productivity and lower costs, as well as optimizing our selling, general and administrative expenses through consolidation and shared service implementation. We also apply these techniques and pricing actions to offset commodity increases and inflationary pricing.

       " Document(page_content='Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to compare and evaluate the period-over-period underlying business operational performance of our segments. Adjusted EBITDA is the sum of earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and impairment expense. Although there are many factors that can impact a segment’s adjusted EBITDA and, therefore, our overall earnings, changes in metal margin of our steel products and downstream products period-over-period is a consistent area of focus for our Company and industry. Metal margin is a metric used by management to monitor the results of our vertically integrated organization. For our steel products, metal margin is the difference between the average selling price per ton of rebar, merchant bar and other steel products and the cost of ferrous scrap per ton utilized by our steel mills to produce these products. An increase or decrease in input costs can impact profitability of these products when there is no corresponding change in selling prices due to competitive pressures. The metal margin for our downstream products is the difference between the average selling price per ton of fabricated rebar and steel fence post products and the scrap input costs to produce these products. The majority of our downstream products selling prices per ton are fixed at the beginning of a project and these projects last one to two years on average. Because the selling price generally remains fixed over the life of a project, changes in input costs over the life of the project can significantly impact profitability. \\nBUSINESS CONDITIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS\\n2023 Acquisitions\\nOn September 15, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Advanced Steel Recovery, LLC (\"ASR\"), a supplier of recycled ferrous metals located in Southern California.

The increase in net cash flows from operating activities was largely due to a decreased scrap price environment during 2023 compared to increased scrap prices in 2022. The decrease in scrap prices reduced cash used by inventory purchases by $432.2 million year-over-year and led to lower steel products average selling prices during 2023 compared to 2022, which contributed to an increase in cash flows from accounts receivable of $432.7 million year-over-year. These fluctuations were partially offset by a year-over-year increase in cash used by accounts payable, accrued expenses and other payables of $178.0 million due, in part, to the declining scrap price environment mentioned above and a reduction in accrued labor-related expenses during 2023 compared to 2022. Additional offsets to the increase in cash flows from operating activities were a $34.3 million decrease in cash flows from deferred income taxes and other long-term taxes and a $15.9 million reduction in loss on debt extinguishment during 2023 compared to 2022.

In September 2023, we opened a new warehouse club in Medellín, Colombia. On November 30, 2023, we plan to open our sixth warehouse club in Guatemala in the city of Escuintla. Additionally, we have plans to open a new warehouse club in Santa Ana, El Salvador, in early 2024. Our distribution network currently consists of major distribution centers in Miami and Costa Rica, complemented by varying distribution facilities in other markets. Based on our experience with the Costa Rica distribution center, we believe that investing in similar distribution centers in other major markets will play a strategic role in a variety of ways. In addition to major distribution centers, PriceSmart has been investing in produce distribution centers, which enable us to purchase, process and package produce we purchase directly from farms in our markets as well as imported produce. \\nII.\\nIncrease Membership Value.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1041803/000104180323000054/0001041803-23-000054-index.htm', 'formId': '0001041803-23-000054'}),\n",

As a result, beginning later in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we strategically held pricing steady across several product categories of our U.S. merchandise imported into Colombia instead of increasing the prices to reflect the rising costs of these items.

In one of the countries where we operate, the government made changes several years ago in the method of computing minimum tax payments, under which the government sought to require retailers to pay taxes based on a percentage of sales if the resulting tax were greater than the tax payable based on a percentage of income (Alternative Minimum Tax or \"AMT\"). We, together with our tax and legal advisers, appealed these interpretations and litigated our cases in the country’s court system. However, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we recorded a $7.2 million charge to settle the AMT payment dispute in this country. Of this amount, $1.0 is related to the reserve for an income tax receivable for one of the tax years for which we sought a refund and the remaining $6.2 million is an accrual for the unpaid years of the dispute. As part of the settlement, we will pay AMT on a go-forward basis, including for fiscal year 2023 for which the amount accrued was $2.0 million. To address the inherent risk of operating in a country in which significant tax legislation changes can significantly impact our low margin business model and limitations on our ability to successfully appeal these burdensome taxes, we have increased prices in this market to offset or partially offset the rise in costs to comply with the annual AMT payment.\\n26\\nTable of Contents', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1041803/000104180323000054/0001041803-23-000054-index.htm', 'formId': '0001041803-23-000054'}),\n",

The periods are established at the beginning of the fiscal year to provide as close a match as possible to the calendar month and quarter that is used for financial reporting purposes. This approach equalizes the number of weekend days and weekdays in each period for improved sales comparison, as we experience higher warehouse club sales on the weekends. Approximately every five years, the Company uses a 53-week year and a six-week “August” to account for the fact that 52 weeks is only 364 days. For fiscal year 2022, we used a 53-week year and a six-week “August.” However, for fiscal year 2023, we have 52 weeks as per the standard calendar year. Further, each of the warehouse clubs used in the calculations was open for at least 13 ½ calendar months before its results for the current period were compared with its results for the prior period\\n.

VAT is a form of indirect tax applied to the value added at each stage of production (primary, manufacturing, wholesale and retail). This tax is similar to, but operates somewhat differently than, sales tax paid in the United States. We generally collect VAT from our Members upon sale of goods and services and pay VAT to our vendors upon purchase of goods and services. Periodically, we submit VAT reports to governmental agencies and reconcile the VAT paid and VAT received. The net overpaid VAT may be refunded or applied to subsequent returns, and the net underpaid VAT must be remitted to the government. \\nWith respect to income taxes paid, if the estimated income taxes paid or withheld exceed the actual income tax due this creates an income tax receivable. In most countries where we operate, the governments have implemented additional collection procedures, such as requiring credit card processors to remit a portion of sales processed via credit and debit cards directly to the government as advance payments of VAT and/or income tax. This collection mechanism generally leaves us with net VAT and/or income tax receivables, forcing us to process significant refund claims on a recurring basis.

       " Document(page_content='We compete in historically cyclical markets.\\nHistorically, the markets in which we compete have been highly cyclical and have experienced significant downturns often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product lifecycles of both component suppliers and electronic equipment manufacturers and/or declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of selling prices and inventory values. Our business depends on the continued growth of technology utilization, the electronics industry and on end-user demand for our customers’ products. Economic downturns often have had an adverse effect upon manufacturers and end-users of electronics products. The timing of new product developments, the lifecycle of existing electronics products and the level of acceptance and growth of new products can also affect demand for our products. Downturns in the markets we serve could have a significant negative impact on the demand for our products. Additionally, due to changing conditions, our customers have experienced and may in the future experience periods of excess inventory that could have a significant adverse impact on our sales. During a downturn in any of the markets that we serve, there is also a higher risk that some of our trade receivables become delinquent or even uncollectible and that our inventory would decrease in value. We cannot predict the timing or the severity of the cycles within our industries. In particular, it is difficult to predict how long and to what levels any industry upturn or downturn, or general economic strength or weakness, will last or develop. Reduced demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nFluctuations in average selling prices may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1616533/000162828023034807/0001628280-23-034807-index.htm', 'formId': '0001628280-23-034807'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Fluctuations in average selling prices may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe markets for our Memory Solutions products have historically been characterized by declines in average selling prices. Our average selling prices may decline due to several factors, including general declines in demand for our products and excess supply of DRAM and Flash memory components as a result of overcapacity. In the past, transitions to smaller design geometries and other factors causing overcapacity in memory markets have led to significant increases in the worldwide supply of memory components. If not accompanied by increases in demand, supply increases usually result in significant declines in component prices and, in turn, declines in the average selling prices and profit margins of our products. During periods of overcapacity, our net sales may decline if we fail to increase sales volume of existing products or to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to offset declines in selling prices. Our efforts to increase sales or to introduce new products to offset the impact of declines in average selling prices may not be successful. Furthermore, our competitors and customers also impose significant pricing pressures on us.

At the closing, SGH paid a cash purchase price of $225 million, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the seller has the right to receive, and SGH is obligated to pay, contingent consideration of up to $50 million (the “Stratus Earnout”) based on the gross profit performance of the Stratus business during the first full 12 fiscal months of Stratus following the closing of the acquisition. The Stratus Earnout is payable in cash, ordinary shares of SGH, or a mix of cash and SGH Shares, at SGH’s election. On June 28, 2023, we provided notice to the Stratus Seller of our election to settle the Stratus Earnout in cash. As of August 25, 2023, current liabilities include $50.0 million for the amount payable for the Stratus Earnout.\\nStratus is a global leader in simplified, protected and autonomous computing platforms and services in the data center and at the Edge. For more than 40 years, Stratus has provided high-availability, fault-tolerant computing to Fortune 500 companies and small-to-medium sized businesses enabling them to securely and remotely run critical applications with minimal downtime.

       " Document(page_content='Factors Affecting Our Operating Performance\\nMacro-Economic Demand Factors.\\n Our business segments each have their own unique set of demand factors. Demand in our Memory Solutions group is driven by end-market demand from OEMs for customer-specific solutions in vertical markets such as industrial, government, networking, high-performance compute and enterprise storage, as well as from OEMs for memory modules used in desktop and notebook computers, smartphones, IoT and SSD products in Brazil. In addition, macro-economic factors specific to the Brazil economy affect this segment, given our sales and operations in that market. Our IPS business is driven by demand for high compute solutions across AI and machine learning initiatives, as well as traditional workload optimization and efficiency applications. Finally, demand for our LED products is derived from targeted end-market applications, such as general high-power and mid-power lighting and specialty lighting, such as video and horticulture applications. We believe our diversified business segments may provide a natural hedge against downturns in any particular industry although broader macro-economic trends, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can adversely affect all three segments concurrently.\\nShifts in the Mix of Our Revenue.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1616533/000162828023034807/0001628280-23-034807-index.htm', 'formId': '0001628280-23-034807'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Shifts in the Mix of Our Revenue.\\n Shifts in the mix of revenue from our operating segments, which can vary significantly from period to period, can impact our business and operating results, including gross and operating margins. For example, our Memory Solutions group, while not party to long-term fixed purchasing commitments, has nonetheless historically seen relatively stable demand and margins. By contrast, our IPS group has shown solid growth, but is subject to greater variability in its sales and margin profile from period to period, as recognition of revenue is tied to customer decisions as to the completion of delivery and system go-live events, and margin is driven by the extent to which higher margin software and managed services comprise IPS sales. In addition, while we have experienced favorable demand and overall margin uplift compared to the rest of our businesses from our LED Solutions group to date, this group is the newest segment of our business, and we may be subject to unforeseen changes in its business and operating results. Our resource commitments and planning for each segment are relatively fixed in the short term, and as such, variability in expected revenue mix will have direct implications for our operating income and margins.\\nOur Ability to Identify, Complete and Successfully Integrate Acquisitions.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1616533/000162828023034807/0001628280-23-034807-index.htm', 'formId': '0001628280-23-034807'}),\n",

Within our existing segments, we plan to pursue acquisitions to expand features and functionality, expand into adjacent businesses and grow our customer base and geographic footprint. From time to time, we may seek to expand our addressable market by entering new business segments where, as we did with our LED business and our recently acquired Stratus Technologies business, we identify a business opportunity at scale with a path to being accretive to our overall operations in the near term. If we are unable to identify and complete attractive acquisitions, we may not be successful in growing our revenue and/or expanding our margins.

We have adopted this “Fab-Light” business model to reduce our capital expenditures and operating expenses, while affording greater flexibility in adapting to shifts in demand and other market trends. Our Fab-Light business model has contributed significantly to margin expansion in our overall business. However, our reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to risk of supply chain disruption and lost business. For example, the current global semiconductor shortage has adversely affected our operating results. In addition, the recent high demand for, and limited supply of, AI components globally, is affecting our sourcing of these components. If such disruptions worsen or are prolonged, or if there is meaningful disruption in our supply arrangement with any of our third-party suppliers, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\\n51\\nResults of Operations\\nYear ended\\nAugust 25,\\n2023\\n% of net\\nsales \\n(1)\\nAugust 26,\\n2022\\n% of net\\nsales \\n(1)\\nAugust 27,\\n2021\\n% of net\\nsales \\n(1)\\nNet sales:\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nMemory Solutions\\n$\\n443,264\\xa0\\n30.8\\xa0\\n%\\n$\\n551,705\\xa0\\n39.5\\xa0\\n%\\n$\\n486,205\\xa0\\n46.1\\xa0\\n%\\nIntelligent Platform Solutions\\n749,708\\xa0\\n52.0\\xa0\\n%\\n440,986\\xa0\\n31.6\\xa0\\n%\\n344,757\\xa0\\n32.7\\xa0\\n%\\nLED Solutions\\n248,278\\xa0\\n17.2\\xa0\\n%\\n403,185\\xa0\\n28.9\\xa0\\n%\\n224,567\\xa0\\n21.3\\xa0\\n%\\nTotal net sales\\n1,441,250\\xa0\\n100.0\\xa0\\n%\\n1,395,876\\xa0\\n100.0\\xa0\\n%\\n1,055,529\\xa0\\n100.0\\xa0\\n%\\nCost of sales\\n1,026,079\\xa0\\n71.2\\xa0\\n%\\n1,004,831\\xa0\\n72.0\\xa0\\n%\\n817,556\\xa0\\n77.5\\xa0\\n%\\nGross profit\\n415,171\\xa0\\n28.8\\xa0\\n%\\n391,045\\xa0\\n28.0\\xa0\\n%\\n237,973\\xa0\\n22.5\\xa0\\n%\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nOperating expenses:\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nResearch and development\\n90,565\\xa0\\n6.3\\xa0\\n%\\n77,472\\xa0\\n5.6\\xa0\\n%\\n59,933\\xa0\\n5.7\\xa0\\n%\\nSelling, general and administrative\\n260,722\\xa0\\n18.1\\xa0\\n%\\n204,839\\xa0\\n14.7\\xa0\\n%\\n158,174\\xa0\\n15.0\\xa0\\n%\\nImpairment of goodwill', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1616533/000162828023034807/0001628280-23-034807-index.htm', 'formId': '0001628280-23-034807'}),\n",

To project average selling prices and sales volumes, we review recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current prices and other factors such as industry analyses of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general economic trends and other information.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\\nForeign Exchange Risk\\nWe are subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy. Our international sales and our operations in foreign countries subject us to risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates. Because a significant portion of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country, possibly leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country. In addition, we have certain costs that are denominated in foreign currencies and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar could result in increases in such costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1616533/000162828023034807/0001628280-23-034807-index.htm', 'formId': '0001628280-23-034807'}),\n",

We present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars and we translate the assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses of a substantial portion of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar may affect the value of these items with respect to our non-U.S. dollar businesses in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency. Our customer pricing and material cost of sales are generally based on U.S. dollars. Accordingly, the impact of currency fluctuations to our consolidated statements of operations is primarily to our other costs of sales (i.e., non-material components) and our operating expenses as those items are typically denominated in local currency. Our consolidated statements of operations are also impacted by foreign currency gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. These translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and equity. As a result, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our reported results.\\nBased on our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as of August\\xa025, 2023 and August\\xa026, 2022, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses recorded in non-operating expense of $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, to revalue these assets and liabilities.\\nInterest Rate Risk', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1616533/000162828023034807/0001628280-23-034807-index.htm', 'formId': '0001628280-23-034807'}),\n",

Alliance’s business, like that of other distributors, is subject to the risk that the value of our inventory will be impacted adversely by suppliers’ price reductions or by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the products comprising the inventory. It is the policy of many suppliers to offer distributors limited protection from the loss in value of inventory due to technological change or a supplier’s price reductions. When protection is offered, the distributor may be restricted to a designated period of time in which products may be returned for credit or exchanged for other products or during which price protection credits may be claimed. Alliance continually takes various actions, including monitoring inventory levels and controlling the timing of purchases, to maximize its protection under supplier programs and reduce inventory risk. However, no assurance can be given that current protective terms and conditions will continue or that they will adequately protect Alliance against declines in inventory value, or that they will not be revised in such a manner as to adversely impact Alliance’s ability to obtain price protection. Alliance is subject to the risk that inventory values may decline, and supplier agreements may not adequately cover the decline in values. Alliance manages these risks through pricing and continual monitoring of existing inventory levels relative to customer demand, reflecting its forecasts of future demand and market conditions. On an ongoing basis, Alliance reduces inventory values for excess and obsolescence to assist in the liquidation of impacted inventories.

Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effectively deploying those techniques across multiple facilities. The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, 3D non-volatile layers, NAND cell levels, process complexity (including the number of mask layers and fabrication steps), and manufacturing yield. Other factors include the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type, cleanliness of our manufacturing environment, and utilization of subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. As we continue to increase our production of high value products and solutions, manufacturing costs are increasingly affected by the costs of application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) controllers and other semiconductors, advanced and complex packaging configurations, and testing at progressively higher performance speeds and quality levels. We continuously enhance our production processes, increase bits per wafer, transition to higher density products, and utilize advanced testing and assembly processes.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723125/000072312523000054/0000723125-23-000054-index.htm', 'formId': '0000723125-23-000054'}),\n",

We strive to balance our demand and supply for each technology node, but the dynamics of our markets and our customers can create periods of imbalance, which can lead us to carry elevated inventory levels. Consequently, we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories, or we may not fully recover our costs, which would reduce our gross margins. For example, in 2023, we recorded aggregate charges of $1.83 billion to write down the carrying value of our inventories to their estimated net realizable value.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended August\\xa031, 2023. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31.

Business – Overview.”\\nIndustry Conditions \\nThe memory and storage industry environment deteriorated sharply in the fourth quarter of 2022 and throughout 2023 due to weak demand in many end markets combined with global and macroeconomic challenges and lower demand resulting from customer actions to reduce inventory levels. This led to significant reductions in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND and bit shipments for DRAM, resulting in declines in revenue across all our business segments and nearly all our end markets. Due to the challenging pricing environment, we recognized charges of $1.83 billion in 2023 to write down inventories to their estimated net realizable value. Ongoing demand growth, customer inventory normalization, and industry-wide supply discipline have set the stage for increased revenue, and improved pricing and profitability throughout fiscal 2024. As a result, pricing trends have started to improve and there were no write downs of inventories to net realizable value in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, further write-downs of inventories in future quarters could occur if pricing expectations deteriorate. Given the challenging pricing environment, elevated levels of inventories for suppliers and customers, and significant supply-demand mismatch, we expect industry profitability will remain challenged into 2024.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723125/000072312523000054/0000723125-23-000054-index.htm', 'formId': '0000723125-23-000054'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='As a result of these conditions and increases in our inventory levels, we have reduced capital expenditures and also significantly reduced wafer starts in 2023 for both DRAM and NAND. We expect wafer starts will remain significantly below peak capacity levels for the foreseeable future as we remain focused on managing down our inventories and controlling our supply. We recognized period costs from fabrication facility underutilization of $382 million in 2023 due to wafer start reductions. We estimate that we will recognize approximately $200 million of period costs from underutilization due to wafer start reductions in the first quarter of 2024. We have also taken significant steps to reduce our costs and operating expenses. These actions include the 2023 Restructure Plan discussed below and additional reductions in external spending, including implementing productivity programs across the business, suspension of our 2023 bonus company-wide, reductions in select product programs, lower discretionary spending, and cuts to 2023 executive salaries across the company.\\nImpact of China Cyberspace Administration Decision\\nOn March 31, 2023, China’s Cyberspace Administration (the “CAC”) notified us that it was conducting a cybersecurity review of our products sold in China. On May 21, 2023, we received notice that the CAC had concluded its review and decided that our products presented a cybersecurity risk. As such, the CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products. There is no list of the companies that have been designated as critical information infrastructure operators published by the Chinese government or otherwise available to us. Therefore, the full impact of the CAC decision on our business remains uncertain. \\n \\n44\\nTable of Contents', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723125/000072312523000054/0000723125-23-000054-index.htm', 'formId': '0000723125-23-000054'}),\n",

In addition, although demand for DRAM and NAND is improving as customer inventory levels continue to normalize and secular growth drivers remain intact, the CAC decision continues to impact our revenue opportunity in China. This significant headwind is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. We are working to mitigate this impact over time and expect quarter-to-quarter revenue variability. Our revenue with companies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors, is approximately a quarter of our worldwide revenue and remains our principal exposure to the CAC decision. Although the impact of the CAC decision remains uncertain, we believe that approximately half of that China-headquartered customer revenue, which equates to a low-double-digit percentage of our worldwide revenue, is at risk of being impacted. Despite the near-term impact to our demand as a result of the CAC decision, our long-term goal is to retain our worldwide DRAM and NAND market share.\\n2023 Restructure Plan', metadata={'source': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/723125/000072312523000054/0000723125-23-000054-index.htm', 'formId': '0000723125-23-000054'}),\n",

Under the plan, we expect our headcount reduction to approach 15% by the end of calendar 2023, through a combination of voluntary attrition and personnel reductions. In connection with the plan, we incurred restructure charges of $171 million in 2023 primarily related to employee severance costs. The 2023 Restructure Plan was substantially completed in 2023. As a result of the 2023 Restructure Plan, we expect to realize cost savings of approximately $130 million per quarter (approximately 60% in cost of goods sold, 30% in R&D, and 10% in SG&A) subsequent to 2023.

In connection therewith, we determined that there was insufficient market validation to justify the ongoing investments required to commercialize 3D XPoint at scale.
